In the autograder, I seem to be failing tests 03, 05 and 08 of trip only when my graph package is being used.

When the staff graph package is used, my Trip.java program is fine.

This is due to a NullPointerException when I call getWeight due setPaths(). In tests 01, 02 and 04,
this exception does not occur. It is only when I am dealing with large graphs that I get a NullPointerException
attempting to access a label. In tests 03 and 08, this exception is raised very late into my setPaths() algorithm.
In test05, it is raised earlier.

Thank you!!
